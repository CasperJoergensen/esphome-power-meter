  # pulse_meter component
  # The pulse_meter component, unfortunately, does not keep updating when the pulse-width stays the same (constant power consumption, say 1000 W).
  # It always updates its total: sub-sensor, but, after a few times, does not apply the filters or call on_value: (or on_raw_value:).
  # This actually makes sense; there's no need to waste bandwidth and power consumption often fluctuates and usually dont stay fixed for long.
  # However, as the intention is to track energy and cost on a time-basis, 'idling' cannot be accepted and thus we end up having to 'hook' into
  # the total: sub-sensor from the power_meter, instead of the main sensor, which isn't ideal, but works.
  # Also... (apparently?!) the total: sensor seems to get a headstart of my calculations and always counts one pulse before on_value: is even called?
  # I decided not to chase that down, as all of this really shouldn't be done this way anyway (custom component anyone?).
  # Besides if you use 1000W when resetting, it'll only end up 0.001 kWh off at the end.
  # Note: The 'lack' of updates in the power_meter component also means that changing the pulse-rate will not take effect until next change in power consumption.

# Using intervals with a duration of 1 second can have a drawback though: Actions might happen up to a second late.
# In the bigger scheme of things, this might not mean much, but it's annoying. Let's say you reset the total count at midnight on the 1st of the month.
# The daily count will also be automatically reset - because it happens to be a new day - but this can happen up to a second later and possibly
# make the total and daily out of sync. If you at midnight have a power consumption of 1000 W and then do a 'manual' reset
# of the total count (clicking the button precisely at midnight), the daily count might end up being up to 0.001 kWh behind the total,
# because it will be reset in the interval, on the next or (if you're lucky) current loop.
# So the options, as I see them, are:
# 1. Acceptance. Making toasties at midnight is forbidden! This is the way.
# 2. Shorten the interval. I feel like having 1 second interval is demanding enough. I'm not keen on shortening it.
# 3. Do all the work in the interval loop, and use some global flags to signal when a reset should take place. (again with the globals!?!)
# 4. Use cron: in an on_time automation instead. But that's looping every second anyhow, and an interval: is more lightweight. I like it light.
# 5. Move the daily reset into the process power script. That way I need neither cron or intervals. However, that could mean very late resets.
# 6. Mow the lawn. Spring is on the doorstep and it needs it badly.
#
# After some divining, head scratching and calling on higher powers, I have decided to implement option 3 and option 6. I have spoken!
