# Here comes a 1 second interval with a single lambda action that runs every second... just for fun.. nah bro, seriously, listen, it's fo' real, check it out...
# Using intervals with a duration of 1 second can have a drawback though: Actions might happen up to a second late.
# In the bigger scheme of things, this might not mean much, but it's annoying. Let's say you reset the total count at midnight on the 1st of the month.
# The daily count will also be automatically reset - because it happens to be a new day - but this can happen up to a second later and possibly
# make the total and daily out of sync. If you at midnight have a power consumption of 1000 W and then do a 'manual' reset
# of the total count (clicking the button precisely at midnight), the daily count might end up being up to 0.001 kWh behind the total,
# because it will be reset in the interval, on the next or (if you're lucky) current loop.
# So the options, as I see them, are:
# 1. Acceptance. Making toasties at midnight is forbidden! This is the way.
# 2. Shorten the interval. I feel like having 1 second interval is demanding enough. I'm not keen on shortening it.
# 3. Do all the work in the interval loop, and use some global flags to signal when a reset should take place. (again with the globals!?!)
# 4. Use cron: in an on_time automation instead. But that's looping every second anyhow, and an interval: is more lightweight. I like it light.
# 5. Move the daily reset into the process power script. That way I need neither cron or intervals. However, that could mean very late resets.
# 6. Mow the lawn. Spring is on the doorstep and it needs it badly.
#
# After some divining, head scratching and calling on higher powers, I have decided to implement option 3 and option 6. I have spoken!
